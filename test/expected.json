      "The SEO strategy call was extremely helpful before we got too deep into setting up our own account. It turns out, we had started down a path in two key areas that would’ve taken more work to undo, so the timeliness of the call answered lingering questions and gave us more clarity. Having already logged in and started the process on our own was crucial because we knew the exact questions to ask and the entire call became a review of what we had done, needed to fix, as well as pointing out key features we hadn’t yet explored.",

      "Managing the SEO for a small business website? Find out why Hike is the perfect alternative to Semrush.",
      "Semrush is a fantastic marketing platform. It supports businesses across multiple marketing channels, but it’s their in-depth SEO feature set that impresses the most; it’s almost unparalleled in the SEO software space and is suitable for even the biggest and most complex websites.",
      "However, if you run a small business website, do you need – or want – this level of SEO data? Does the average small business website need to analyse SEO down to the most granular detail in order to compete? Not really, no. If anything, this level of detail makes SEO harder to understand and implement for the average small business. And that’s where Hike comes in.",
      "Let’s look at some of the key differences between Hike and Semrush in terms of price, features and approach.",
      "There’s no denying that Semrush is a far more expensive software for a small business.",
      "Their cheapest subscription starts at $119.95/month, and every extra user costs a whopping $45/month.",
      "Hike meanwhile costs only $59.99/month, with unlimited extra users for free!",
      "Of course, Semrush provides more data so naturally it should cost more. But the question is does a small business need that level of data? We don’t think so.",
      "Rory Armitage-Burns, Vice Reversa\nSource:Google Reviews",
      "Get Started",
      "Semrush provides a high and granular level of SEO data for you to dig through. Perfect for large, enterprise websites and experienced SEO teams.",
      "Is this level of analysis overkill for a small business, who targets local customers? Very likely.",
      "Hike provides only the data a small business needs to compete. The majority of our customers have 2-10 employees and that’s exactly who we provide the perfect SEO software for.",
      "Large SEO agencies use Semrush effectively. They have lots of time to spend on SEO. But small businesses don’t have that luxury. Small businesses don’t have unlimited time to spend on their SEO. That’s why Hike optimizes your time for the greatest results. Tell Hike how much time you have and it tells you exactly what to do in that time, with detailed and easy to follow instructions on how to complete each step.",
      "\nGet Started",
      "Semrush provides their customers with support across 3 main channels; live-chat, email and phone. Just like we do here at Hike.",
      "Where Hike differs is in our free onboarding support and additional fulfilment offerings.",
      "We know our customers aren’t experts in SEO, so it’s only natural that you might not know exactly how to set up your SEO properly at the beginning. That’s why, if you need it, we’ll record you a free SEO strategy video review .",
      "We also have a team of SEO experts in-house who can support you with actually making SEO changes to your website. Think of Hike as your on-demand SEO team!",
      "Stuart Williams, Ace Car Care\nSource:Google Reviews",
      "Get Started",
      "One area where Hike really excels against Semrush are it’s features and support for small digital agencies.",
      "Hike has a wide range of agency-specific features to help you sell, deliver and retain SEO revenue. Such as full white-labelling, reporting and lead-generation features.",
      "And it’s our price point that really stands out vs Semrush. To enable white-label costs only an extra $25/month. Over at Semrush it costs a whopping $100/month extra!",
      "I have to say I’ve been really impressed with Hike and it’s the first time I can really see what goes into SEO. I now know that – up until using Hike – we had totally wasted money on so-called experts.",

      "MR Cricket Hockeyis an e-commerce website that sells cricket and hockey equipment. They have a physical store but they also wanted to capitalise on the increasing demand for sports equipment online, and so creating an e-commerce website was vital.",
      "SEO is an increasingly important channel for them, especially as more and more sales move online – and away from physical retail – in these shifting times. In this case study, we speak to Merrick Fuller (who leads MR Cricket Hockey’s sales development) about his previous experience with SEO for the site, why they chose the Hike platform and the Support services, and their results since signing up.",
      "I cannot recommend Hike highly enough. The platform is great, it’s in a language that anyone can understand, and there is a clear path to what you want to achieve. Also, their support services have allowed us to focus on running the business whilst knowing our SEO is still being worked on.",

      "This huge increase in performing keywords on page 1 has translated into a huge 135% increase in SEO traffic year-on-year when comparing 2020 to 2021 (and is set to continue into 2022!):",
      "We had used various SEO specialists which we would pay a monthly fee and they would report on a monthly basis or – more likely – when we would chase them. Before Hike, SEO seemed to be a black hole where you would give someone money and not really know what they would be doing for it!",
      "Merrick Fuller",
      "MR Cricket Hockey",
      "When MR Cricket Hockey joined Hike they had used SEO agencies & freelancers previously, but as they were unhappy with the results that were achieved. MR Cricket Hockey wanted to gain a better understanding of SEO and so came to Hike.",
      "The Hike platform audited their website and saw many areas for improvements that – since implementing – have pushed them to the top of Google. Below details the process and changes made that have contributed to MR Cricket Hockey’s SEO success so far…",
      "The MR Cricket Hockey team utilised Hike’s SEO strategy creation service to help them build the right SEO strategy within Hike. The Hike team worked with MR Cricket Hockey to find the best keywords they should target in Google, the website structure they needed to employ, what content they needed to create and who their top competitors were.",
      "With this information now in Hike, the platform itself got to work! Before we knew it Hike was providing MR Cricket Hockey with top SEO actions to implement that would kickstart their SEO. Next; creating new landing pages and updating ‘thin’ content.",
      "One of the key areas that Hike identified as important for their success was having the right category page structures and content on those pages. Hike gave specific recommendations on new pages to create, based on the keywords they wanted to rank for. It also alerted the MR Cricket Hockey team on pages across the site where the content was not at the high level required for successful SEO performance.",
      "This was one of the first areas that the team tackled to improve the SEO of the website. Next; updating metadata.",
      "The Hike platform immediately identified improvements that the MR Cricket Hockey website needed to make to the website’s metadata across its main category and product pages. These were based specifically on the keywords added into the Hike, so these suggestions are tailored to the customers MR Cricket Hockey wants to be in front of.",
      "The platform also identified keyword cannibalisation – instances where the current SEO on the website was confusing Google and resulting in lower SEO rankings. Resolving these – which is key for e-commerce stores with categories and products – was hugely instrumental to their current success. Next; page speed.",
      "Following completing the more content and keyword optimisation actions that Hike recommended for the MR Cricket Hockey website, they then moved onto the next important task that Hike found that would improve the SEO: improving page speed.",
      "Top tip: Want to know your own page speed score? Then check out ourFree SEO Reportthat will tell you that and more!",
      "Page speed is not only super important for the user experience (and ultimately, onsite conversions and sales), but it’s also a ranking factor. this means that ensuring the page speed meets certain criteria will give the website improved SEO visibility.",

      "“I’ve been in SEO for 9 years and have helped a HUGE variety of clients, from one-man-bands to international e-commerce retailers. I love teaching people how they can drive more customers and leads through organic search. Being a startup ourselves we know how important this is for new businesses.”",
      "I’m the technical co-founder of Hike, and I’ve led the build of the platform. I’ve been doing SEO for over 9 years, having worked for clients either at an agency, or freelance. Helping startups & small businesses is fantastic as their products are often unique, and I’m super excited to show them how to use this to their advantage.",
      "“I’m the Senior Digital Marketing Executive at Hike and have experience in both project management and copy writing. After completing my degree in Marketing at NTU, I found my passion for the digital world and am excited to learn more about SEO as well as supporting our customers to succeed.”",
      "“I’m new to the industry, however I’ve learned to develop software over the past few years through working on a start-up project. I’ve spent the past 5 years as a data analyst for an international insurance company, working on a range of interesting projects, from complaints to financial crime. I now can’t wait to start improving my development skills and hopefully utilise some of my previous experience to add value here at Hike.”",
      "“Since graduating from DMU in Business Management I discovered my true passion for Digital Marketing. I am currently finishing my MSc Digital Marketing studies and am excited to implement all of my knowledge – and learn more! SEO is such a significant factor in Digital Marketing, I am keen to better my experience and accomplish positive results for all of our customers.”",
      "“For the past few years, I have been working for various phone companies. After some time I realised that I wanted to step my foot into the digital world. With a computing degree from the University of Sussex under my wing, I was on the hunt to make use of my degree and learn something new. As Digital Marketing Executive at Hike, I am learning how SEO can truly benefit businesses. I am excited to get stuck in and make a real impact in this industry.”",
      "“As somebody who has no previous knowledge of SEO, I decided to join Hike to learn and explore the world of Digital Marketing. Hike has given me a platform to grow and understand the importance of SEO. I am excited about learning and developing my skills to help our customers reach their goals.”",
      "“After graduating from the University of Lincoln, I’ve settled quickly into the world of Digital Marketing and SEO. Being at Hike has helped me understand how important SEO is, and I am thoroughly enjoying getting stuck into it, supporting our customers and learning more every day.”",
      "“I have 14 years of industry experience covering all aspects of web technology: from brochure websites, PR and SEO campaigns to large ecommerce platforms and bespoke CMS systems; with a recent focus on SaaS platforms and high traffic microsites. I’m really happy to bring over a decade of experience to Hike SEO and look forward to helping our users and product offering grow.”",
      "“During my time at Sheffield Hallam University studying Marketing, Communications & Advertising I developed a passion for digital marketing. Working for Hike has allowed me to understand the importance of SEO, and I am excited to further expand my knowledge and support our clients to achieve the results they are looking for.”",
      "“I am just beginning my SEO journey with Hike. After finishing my Modern Languages degree I wasn’t sure what career path I wanted to take, then during my time working in a customer service role I started getting involved in a few digital marketing tasks and instantly wanted to learn more. That’s when I stumbled across Hike.\nI am really excited to learn all about SEO, the services that Hike offer and begin helping customers to solve their SEO problems.”",
      "“Having studied Human Geography at university, SEO is initially a foreign language to me. With several years of retail experience, I wanted a change and Hike has given me the opportunity to develop myself. I am looking forward to expanding my skills and diving into the deep end! I am excited to start supporting our customers by helping them achieve their wanted results.”",
      "“With over 7 years experience in building software applications for companies ranging from early stage start-ups to large enterprises, my most recent focus being on enterprise e-commerce and microservices. I am excited to bring my expertise to Hike and help customers enhance their SEO.”",
